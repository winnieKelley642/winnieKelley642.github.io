Treehouse Project 3 - interactive form

index.html and style.css was provided by treehouse

I have edited index.html only as the project guideline requested.
In style.css I made the following changes:
1. background colour for body
2. background colour for form

I downloaded the normalize.css to clear out the css
I created the sript.js file and all the contents in it.

FOR THIS PROJECT I AM GOING FOR EXCEEDS EXPECTATION:
for the obvious error messaging part of the project this is what I did.
When submit button is clicked: anything that is invalid will now have a red strip next to the invalid sections.

for exceeds, I have made it so that the following happens on key up:
1. name:
    1a. if name is blank, or not vaoid, it'll display error message
    1b. if name is valid, it will say "Hi, (user input)"

2. email:
    2a. if email is blank or not valid, it'll display error message.
    2b. if email is valid it will say that it is valid

3. credi card:
    3a. credit card number, zip, cvv:
        3ai. if the number is blank or invalid, it will show that it is invalid
        3ai. once the user start typing , it will let user know how many more numbers or how many numbers they are over for the valid amount. 
        3aiii. if it is valid, it will let the usaer konow.

Also, colour drop down menu is hidden until theme is selected for t-shirt.

This is project 5 of Treehouse FSJS
Fetching from api.

I am going for exceed expectation for the grade.
I was working on adding a no match message feature but haven't been able to add it yet. But since my deadline to turn this project in is up and this feature isn't required (for grading purposes). I am going to submit it with the no match message parts commented out, and submit the project and then try and fix the issue.

For this project 12 users are randomly generated, and each "card" can be clicked on and more information will be displayed in a modal.

For exceeds, I added the following:
- search feature so the user can search by name. 
- in modual display, there are arrows to navigate between each card
- edited css including:
    - background colour
    - font colour
    - hover features:
        - colour change
        - card shrinks to only show image

Thank you!
